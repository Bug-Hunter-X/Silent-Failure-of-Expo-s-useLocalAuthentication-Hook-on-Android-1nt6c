This bug occurs when using the Expo `useLocalAuthentication` hook on Android.  The hook may fail silently, without providing any error messages in the console or returning an error value. This makes debugging extremely difficult, as there's no obvious indication why authentication failed. The authentication might fail due to various reasons such as fingerprint sensor malfunction, incorrect configuration, or missing permissions, but no error is returned to help pinpoint the issue.
